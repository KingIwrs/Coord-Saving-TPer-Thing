# Coord-Saving-TPer-Thing
Adds the TP'er Thing, which allows you to save coordinates to it, and teleport to the saved coordinates from anywhere.

To change the coordinates on one of them, simply recraft it the same way you craft it to begin with, and you will get it back without the coordinates.  
That does remove custom names as well though.
